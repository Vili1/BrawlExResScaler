# BrawlExResScaler
Dynamic resolution scaler for Brawlhalla.
For more resolution control use my other tool [BrawlXRC](https://github.com/Vili1/BrawlXRC)

# Important!
- This tool works only with the Steam version of the game, it relies on gameoverlayrenderer.dll to be injected in to the game whitch steam does that for you.
- This tool is an unofficial hack.
- The config is explained with comments in the source code, look for loadConfig().

### Usage
- Disable EAC by setting -noeac as a launch option on steam.
- Open the game then open BrawlExResScaler.exe.

### TODO
- Adjst the res based on objects on screen.
- Adjst the res based on GPU load.
